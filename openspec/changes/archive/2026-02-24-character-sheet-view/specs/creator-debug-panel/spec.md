## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Debug panel displays draft JSON when query param is set
**Reason**: The debug panel is fully replaced by the character sheet preview component. Raw JSON display is no longer needed.
**Migration**: The character sheet preview provides a richer, player-facing view of the same draft data. No debug-specific replacement is planned.

### Requirement: Debug panel uses syntax highlighting
**Reason**: Removed along with the debug panel component.
**Migration**: None needed. The syntax-highlighted JSON view is removed entirely.
