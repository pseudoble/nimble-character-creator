## 1. Two-Column Grid Layout

- [x] 1.1 In `character-sheet.tsx`, wrap the Skills section and the info sections (Ancestry Trait, Background, Equipment, Gold, Languages) in a `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4` container
- [x] 1.2 Place Skills in the left column (as a single grid child)
- [x] 1.3 Wrap Ancestry Trait, Background, Equipment, Gold, and Languages in a right-column `div` with `space-y-4` for vertical stacking

## 2. Verification

- [x] 2.1 Verify the `/sheet` page renders the two-column layout with all sections visible
- [x] 2.2 Verify the creator preview panel renders the two-column layout and updates live as fields change
- [x] 2.3 Verify conditional visibility still works in preview mode (sections appear/hide correctly in both columns)
